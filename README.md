# Password Generator

## Javascript - Module 3

This assignment had us create a password generator and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.<br><br>

This involved collecting information from the user, testing to make sure that what they input matched the criteria that was required. Prompting the user when a mistake was made to input the correct information and then generating a random password.<br><br>
